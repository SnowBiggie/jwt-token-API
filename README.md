Login:
When a user logs in, you need to check if the user exists in the database. If the user exists, you should generate an access token and a refresh token. The access token is used to authenticate the user in subsequent requests, while the refresh token is used to generate a new access token when the access token expires. You should store the refresh token in the database for future use. Finally, you should send the user's data (username, isAdmin, accessToken, refreshToken) in the response.
If the user doesn't exist or the login credentials are invalid, you should generate an error and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).

Refresh Token:
When a user requests to refresh their access token, you need to check if the refresh token they provided is the correct one. If the refresh token is correct, you should verify the token's authenticity and generate a new access token and refresh token. You should then send the user's data (accessToken, refreshToken) in the response.
If the refresh token is invalid or expired, you should generate an error and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).

Verify Token:
When a user sends a request to the server, you need to check if the request contains an access token in the HTTP headers (headers.authorization). If the token exists, you should use the verify method of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify the token's authenticity. If the token is valid, you can proceed with the user's request. If the token is invalid or expired, you should generate an error and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).

Delete:
When a user requests to delete their account, you need to check if the request contains the user's ID in the parameters (params.userId) and if the user is an admin. If the conditions are met, you can delete the user from the database. If the conditions are not met, you should generate an error and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 403 Forbidden).

Logout:
When a user logs out, you need to delete their refresh token from the database to prevent unauthorized access. There's no need to send a response to the user for this operation.
